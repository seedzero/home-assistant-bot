# home-assistant-bot
Former Reddit bot for /r/HomeAssistant

Obsolete project. I used this bot to help grow the Home Assistant subreddit in the beginning, when there weren't many posts. It was a fun little project when I first started with Python.
Used to post items from the home-assistant.io blog to the /r/homeassistant subreddit. Also added flair to indicate a new release or a blog post.
